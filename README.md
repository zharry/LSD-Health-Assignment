# LSD Health Assignment

## LSD!?
* In grade 7, during the health unit our teacher assignment us into groups and were told to make a presentation on a drug of our choice.
* So me and my partner, decided it would be fund and interesting to see what would happen if we made a presentation with GameMaker.

## Usage
* The compiled finished product is located in the "Binaries" folder
* **The "Game", is not a game, we simply did not have enough time to make a full game, instead it is just a prompt for a questionaire or quiz**
* Click "Begin Presentation"
* The small left-pointing arrow is used to navigate back to the main menu
* The double down arrow is used to pull up extra information
* The left and right arrows are used to navigate the slides

###### Note: The gamemaker source lacks some of the text found in the compiled binary due to transportation errors.
